        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cubed</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1(16 oz) package penne pasta</li>
            <li>2 cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add chicken, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add broth and heavy cream; stir in pasta and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until pasta is tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Grease an 11x17-inch baking pan.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/2 the pasta mixture into the prepared pan. Sprinkle 1/2 the Parmesan cheese and 1/2 the mozzarella cheese over the pasta. Layer remaining pasta on top; finish with remaining Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses.</li>
            <li>Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
